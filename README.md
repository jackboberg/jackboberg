# jackboberg

> Print up to date contact information

## Usage

```sh
npx jackboberg
```

## Background

Inspired by [johnkpaul] and [searls], but this approach does not require 
installing a global module, and it will always be up to date. It pretty prints 
by default, and outputs JSON if specified.

```sh
npx jackboberg -j
npx jackboberg --json
```
